## wiring 
The Suhr style HSS wiring ensures that the humbucker sees a regular humbucker load (usually 500k vol and 500k tone = 250k load) and the single coils see a regular single coil load (usually 250k vol and 250k tone = 125k load). This is achieved by utilizing a 5 way superswitch (4P5T) which introduces resistors in parallel from hot to ground, in order to modify the total load in the circuit. Some modifications to the Suhr diagram include a neck on and bridge split option.2 The typical Suhr Classic wiring is master volume and two tone controls, but some custom guitars may use different wiring methods.0 Some users have suggested using 500k volume and 500k tone pots to boost the bass/mids, but this has been disputed.

5 way auto split pos 2    
Typically speaking, humbuckers use 500k pots and single coils use 250k. This is the same with capacitors - humbuckers typically use 0.022uF and single coils typically use 0.047uF. This setup uses a 470k resistor on the tone control to negate this. Position 2 auto splits the humbucker (slug coil).

### stacked 250/500 volume pot
- tone 1 (250k) controls both neck and middle
- tone 2 (500k) controls bridge pickup
- no need for resistors
  - bridge pickup uses the 500k side of the volume pot and 500k tone
  - neck and middle use 250k side of the volume pot and 250k tone
- need to evaluate the super switch

## existing AVRI Hot Rod Pickups
These Alnico V, staggered magnet pickups also feature Formvar wire and bevelled polepieces, all essential stuff for vintage-aholics. Moving forward a few years, the bridge pickup is then wired to the lower tone control, which is a sensible mod for any Strat as it enables you to smooth out the high-end.

Sounds
There's a good deal of hubris - some of which is deserved - when it comes to replacement pickups for guitars. But before you go spending all that cash, just listen to Fender's latest incarnation of its American Vintage single-coils.

These are relatively low-power units (Fender claims 5.3k DC resistance) but that's absolutely to their benefit, bringing out shimmering highs and a warm bottom end with that characteristic slight scoop in the middle that's quintessential Strat.

You might want to think of it as 'woody', because the pickups are in no way overpowering what the body and neck bring to the table.


## set up
-SUHR ACTION SPEC-

•NECK RELIEF: while pressing on the D & G strings on the 1st and 17th fret, the relief should measure .005” (0.127mm) at the 7th fret. A capo can be used on the 1st fret.
•ACTION: Open strings should measure: 4/64” (1.587mm) at the last fret
•Gotoh 510 Bridge Plate: Approximately 3/64” (1.190mm) above body

-SUHR PUP HEIGHT-

• ALL SINGLE COILS: LOW E 8/64” (3.175mm) HIGH E 6/64” (2.381mm)
• NECK HUMBUCKER: LOW E 7/64” (2.778mm) HIGH E 6/64” (1.587mm)
• BRIDGE HUMBUCKER: LOW E 6/64” (2.381mm) HIGH E 5/64” (1.984mm)
• S90’S: LOW E 8/64” (2.778mm) HIGH E 6/64” (2.381mm)
*(Make sure strings are depressed at the last fret when measuring)

IMPORTANT: Please measure and set specs in the playing position.

We hope this information proves useful to you!
