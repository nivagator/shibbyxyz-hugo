![controls](../img/5e3-mod-controls.jpg)
a view of the controls from below.  
left to right:
- V1 preamp tube
- Negative feedback switch
  1. stock 5e3 (toggle in toward the interior of the amp)
     - no feedback and the cathode bypass capacitor in circuit - highest gain and maximum early breakup tweediness.
  2. no negative feedback, no V2A cathode bypass capacitor (toggle center position)
     - moderate gain and civility--a nice compromise tone
     - shifts the 5E3's distortion balance so you'll get less preamp and phase inverter distortion but more power tube distortion at the same volume. If you do this mod you owe it to yourself to play around with this setting, it's pretty cool. This setting is also great with boost and distortion pedals.
  3. negative feedback full (toggle toward rear of the amp)
     - no cathode bypass capacitor - lowest gain with tight lows, sharp transition to distortion, less noise and hiss and extra headroom for a very clean and civilized tone
- V2 preamp tube
- 10% power switch
  1. full power (toggle in toward the interior of the amp)
  2. 10% power (toggle toward rear of the amp)
- Master Volume (clockwise increases volume)
- Speaker out
