[mr blaine: Axle u joint replacement | WTJF](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/axle-u-joint-replacement.1110/post-13944)  

**Mr Blaine:**
- never use a press on axle ujoints  
- The hammer and socket method wont damage the yoke. 
- No need to protect the cap being driven in, it is much harder than any hammer so don't be afraid to beat on it.
- When you drive the first cap in, take it below flush so the other pin is sticking out a bit further. That way you can pull the cross halfway out of the installed cap and it sticks up high enough on the other side to get the second cap started and engage the needle bearings in both caps. That prevents a needle from falling over and getting trapped which is always a mess. That is also when you install the clip in the first cap's groove so when you hammer in the second cap, it pushes the first one back against the snap ring.
- When that is done, the second groove will be showing and when you install the snap ring, it will be loose. You need to set the caps back against the snap rings so the pressure of the cap pushes them against the inside of the yoke. That is done by holding the assembled axle pointing straight away from you in one hand and then taking a nice size hammer and smacking the yoke on the fat part right below the holes for the caps. Inertia will act upon the cross and move the cap outward to lock the snap ring in place. You can check all of this very simply. Once you get the joint installed, move it back and forth and you can feel the tightness from one side being shoved against the thrust bearing inside the cap. After you set both side back against the snap rings, it will free up the joint in a most noticeable manner.
- You should also try to rotate the snap ring in the groove with the end of a screwdriver by pushing on it. If it doesn't spin easily, that's good enough.
- Also why you see folks struggling to remove the snap rings. They don't understand that the previous installer did it correctly and they need to release the pressure by first smacking the cap inwards before trying to pry out the snap ring and then doing the same to the other side to get that snap ring out.

The idea is to insert a relay to interrupt the momentary ground that the pcm needs to enable both the lockers and the dash light circuits. If you wanted to enable lockers on all tcase positions, you have to do the wandering trail mod on top of this.

### spooling line
Do a locked Brummel eye about 14" in from the end of the line and leave the tail out after a very short bury. Make the eye large enough for the end terminal (thimble or hook) to fit through. Eye goes over the top of the drum, around the backside, out forward under the drum. Other end goes through the eye, snugs up tight against current anchor side, tail lays across drum and gets taped down and cut to length drum width. As soon as you tension it, it will snug up tight but no matter what, you can't pull the line loose from the winch if you screw up.

This is a bolt-in job, there's not much to it. Just know that there's usually no reason to have to replace the flywheel unless it is physically damaged. Also, don't have the surface of the flywheel resurfaced or refinished. The TJ's flywheel has a domed surface that would be removed if it was resurfaced. At the most, if it has any glazing on its surface, just remove it with a mild grade of sandpaper or emery cloth.

About the only thing not included in that kit that I'd recommend would be a different throwout bearing than what is included.

TJ Rubicon front driveshafts use a nylon injection to hold the axle end yoke u-joint in place. There are no snap rings or c-clips. You heat up the yoke and the nylon literally shoots out the injection hole. Once removed, clear the channel where the nylon was and use inner c-clips with the replacement u-joint.

## alignment
[How to align your Jeep Wrangler TJ](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/how-to-align-your-jeep-wrangler-tj.85/)  

set your toe-in so the fronts of the tires are 1/16" to 1/8" closer together in front than in the rear  
Re-centering the steering wheel is required whenever the toe-in is adjusted or when the suspension height changes. That is easily done by rotating the short adjustment link on the drag link after loosening its two clamps.

[How to bleed your brakes](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/how-to-bleed-your-brakes.528/)

Two quarts of DOT 3/4 is what you need. Start by using a turkey baster to suck the old dirty fluid out of the brake reservoir.

On a system that's never been bled before you may find yourself running 64oz+ through it to get clean fluid. You can do this initial bleed to get clean fluid one person, once it's clean you're going to need a second person to help. If you don't, air can get past the bleeder threads. Don't let the MC run dry.

Don't store open brake fluid, once you open a container it needs to be used.

If you need more than 5-7 bleeds per corner, stop and find the problem because flushing more fluid down the drain isn't going to fix the problem.

Open screw, pedal to the floor hard and fast, close screw, let pedal up, repeat.

## cooling system 

Drilling a hole into the thermostat's flange like shown below and positioning the hole at the top when installing it will help get rid of the trapped air more quickly. Some thermostats come with a vent hole already, just make sure to position it at the top when installing it.

northstar  

"Calcium" AGM like the offerings from NAPA, O'Reillys, Duracell, etc., - good batteries at a more reasonable price point and suitable for most jeepers looking to upgrade from a flooded lead acid battery who either can't afford the price point of a Northstar or don't need the features of a pure lead AGM battery. I will probably buy one of these as my next battery

East Penn vs northstar  
differences between "thick plate calcium AGM batteries" such as the offerings by East Penn, and "thin plate pure lead AGM's" which include Northstar, Odyssey and Optima. The article concludes:

"Both the calcium AGM and the pure lead AGM crank longer and are more tolerant of deep cycle drains than OE maintenance-free batteries. That said, there is a performance difference among these two types of AGM battery. Since the thinner plates in the pure lead AGM have more surface area contact than the thicker plates in the calcium AGM, they are more efficient during both discharging and recharging. The calcium AGM is 'better' while the pure lead AGM is 'best.'"

See: http://www.hendonpub.com/law_and_order/articles/2015/04/agm_battery_technology

It appears from the article that in the hierarchy of AGM's the Napa Legend is better than a flooded lead acid battery but not in the same category as a pure lead AGM battery such as Northstar, Odyssey and Optima. It also explains the substantial price difference between the East Penn offerings and those of the other AGM manufacturers.

Be sure to get a Group 24 instead of a group 34 for the extra capacity.(?)  

34 is original  
24 is taller, more capacity but lower amps

[WTFJ: Irun post](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/a-lesson-learned%E2%80%94keep-it-light-and-nimble.44924/post-849881)  

This is very, very true! Anyone installing a RMS should make sure to use the supplied plastic tab, to ensure the top seal doesn't get knicked. I've learned this one the hard way and had to make a trip to the part store for a second seal kit. Also, care has to be taken to ensure both the upper and lower halves are installed correctly, with the small lip facing forward.

Getting the pan off, with the front Dana 30 or 44 in place, requires unbolting the shocks, dropping the rear as far as it will go, and loosening the exhaust bolts, so the pan will clear.

@rasband: All thread (or a long bolt), a cup that the housing can rest against, and a socket that is big enough to go around the bolt hole and rest on the washer on the snap ring side. 

[mr blaine: Johnny Joint Maintenance | WTJF](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/johnny-joint-maintenance.54875/post-957708)   
Two things are key. First, the socket you use to push in the washer to take the load off the snap ring needs to be larger than the hole in the washer by enough not to tilt into the hole. It also needs to be smaller than the amount of room that it takes to pop the snap ring out of the groove. **You can grind a flat on one side to give the snap ring eyes room to pop out.**  

The second thing is when you using all thread to squeeze the washer, **the opposite side needs to be on the body, not the other washer**. Otherwise, you can move the wrong washer or really have to squeeze the races towards each other in hopes that the one under the snap ring moves. React against the body opposite the snap ring and it all works much better.  

[rasband | Jeep Wrangler TJ Forum](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/rocky-mountain-billy-goat-build.14166/post-908661):  
JJ balls have a small line around the collar of one of the two sides. This signifies the side that should be facing the snap ring. This is to note the side that’s marginally longer to account for the snap ring added on that side. It’s slight, but measurable at 1/16” on a 2.5” JJ.

Sharp washer edge goes away from the rubber bushing

[Regearing from 4.88 to Revolution Gear's new 5.38... sweet! | Jeep Wrangler TJ Forum](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/regearing-from-4-88-to-revolution-gears-new-5-38-sweet.7570/)
- After removing the carrier, the existing pinion gear depth was measured using the bearing cap seating surface as a reference point. That gave a very good preliminary depth from which to set the new pinion gear depth. Setting the pinion gear depth involves shimming it in/out with shims included in the master install kit.  
- we’re measuring down to the thousandth of an inch.
- It requires a bearing puller to pull the carrier and pinion bearings off. The bearings have a TIGHT fit so they require a bearing puller powered by an impact wrench. It takes a while for the bearing to finally come off even with this setup.
- Installing the ring gear requires Loctite be applied to the new ring gear bolts. That prevents the bolts from backing out which can destroy pretty much everything inside the housing. Some use blue Loctite but we used red which is more secure. Revolution's ring gear fit over the Rubicon locker snugly/perfectly without needing to heat the ring gear and freeze the locker/carrier as some require.
- Pressing the pinion bearings using a hydrolic press
- Reinstalling the Rubicon locker reuses the Rubicon's OE carrier shims to position it left/right to create the right amount of backlash between the gears. Too little backlash between them can cause insufficient lubrication between the gears and damage the tooth surfaces, too much backlash reduces strength. We ended up with the backlash being right on at .008, same as it was originally.
- This pic shows using a brass punch to tap in the shim. Using brass here eliminates damage to the shim. Just be careful you get the same shims back in the same sides they came out of.
- Painting the gear marking compound onto the gear teeth.
- Part of the setup procedure requires setting the pinion bearing preload which requires a small 1/4" drive in-lbs. bar-indicator torque wrench. Revolution specifies between 14 and 19 inch-lbs. of resistance required to rotate the pinion gear. We ended up right at 18 inch-lbs.
- Checking the final backlash between the gears. Revolution Gear specified .006 to .010, we ended up at .008.
- One thing about the Rubicon’s locker and sensor, you have to pay attention to getting the carrier and sensor situated correctly together. With help from Brook at RGA and danb303 and TJR238 here on JF, I used the “toothpick” technique to fully extend the sensor's pin out far enough to clear and avoid damage while inserting the locker back into the housing.
- Once the locker is back in place after the final pattern and preload adjustments have been completed, you pull the toothpick out with the fishing line tied to it. That releases the sensor to seat properly behind the locker’s actuator plate. However, this is only a concern if you have a Rubicon.


### Tools needed 
The only specialized tools required include a press for the new bearings, bearing puller, dial indicator for the backlash setting, a ½” torque wrench, and an inch-lbs. beam-style ¼” torque wrench for setting the pinion bearing preload.  

### Rubicon info blerbs
"Thick" gear sets are what you need for your Rubicon lockers and X2 on the recommendation for Revolution Gear & Axle's gears. For 35's X2 for 5.38 if you're running the automatic, definitely.  
revolution 4.88 gears from allens offroad  
Note the ‘Thick’ ring gear designation on the label. That means they fit and work with the Rubicon lockers made to work with higher (lower number) ratios. A conventional non-thick 5.38 ring gear will not work with the TJ Rubicon lockers.

### Ring and Pinion Break in Procedure
When installing a new ring and pinion it is recommended to properly break in the new components. The proper break in procedure will extend the life of the components and help with the prevention of premature failure usually caused by extreme heat.  
Although your new ring and pinion is “Lapped” from the factory for smooth quiet operation, they will still need to be broken in once they have been installed. A new ring and pinion will initially run hotter when new and can cause extensive damage if the temperature exceeds ideal operating conditions for an extended period of time. The suggested break in procedure is as follows:  
- The first drive with the new ring and pinion should be under normal driving conditions (No hard starts, No racing, No off-roading, No towing and not at Highway speeds).
- The vehicle should be driven 15-20 minutes around town, normal stop and go driving. Then you should let the axle assembly “Completely Cool” (this will allow the gear oil to cool down so it does not reach temperatures that will break down the oil, causing loss of protection)
- Repeat the 10-15 minute drive and cooling off period 2-3 times
- Then you will want to drive on the highway and repeat the process at least 2 times abiding by local speed laws but not exceeding 65 MPH, be sure to let the axle assembly completely cool between drives (very important).
- Lastly you will want to change the gear oil after the initial 500-1000 miles and your gears are broken in correctly.
Note: If vehicle will be used for towing, repeat the break in procedure the first time it is used to tow.

Follow the factory service manual for recommended differential service intervals unless the vehicle is used in extreme conditions on a regular basis, you will want to service the differential more often.  
(Recommended gear oil is an 85-140W, Non-Synthetic, GL5 grade or Higher, Name Brand Oil. Please note extreme weather conditions may require alternative weight oil so be sure to consult a local mechanic or lube technician for recommendations)

[SKF 18731 Grease Seals](https://a.co/d/fyvCeIh)  

Timken 9912S or Dana 35239. The Dana would have been factory, the Timken is a different design with an expanding skirt that tightens up into the tube bore when you crank Down the retainer plate nuts. Helps prevent leaks. Many fans of the true 9912s here. Just don’t order the 9912S from Amazon because you’ll get fake crap. Order from rockauto. BTW, to find axle seals on rockauto, you need to go to “brake and wheel hub” and then to the “wheel seal” section.  they 

[Rear Dana 44 axle seal | Jeep Wrangler TJ Forum](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/rear-dana-44-axle-seal.65058/post-1200085)  
X2, you need to remove the existing bearing and bearing retainer to place the seal. You want a SET10 bearing set, the Timken 9912S from rockauto, not amazon is the right choice for the seal.

The old bearings are removed by drilling a big hole in the bearing retainer, stopping the drill bit before it reaches the axle shaft. A cold chisel across the hole will break it so it can be removed.  
Then you'll need a press to install the new SET10 bearings, seal, and bearing retainer. It should look like this once they're pressed into place. This shows the disk brake type of axle retainer bracket, the one for drum brakes is flat without the flange.

## clean IAC  
Basically start the engine then spray throttle body cleaner into the throttle body at idle rpms. The IAC will only draw the cleaner in through itself when the engine is at idle. The cleaner will flood the IAC so the engine will die. That's ok, just restart the engine. Plus the extra time the cleaner sits inside the IAC after the engine dies and before you restart it helps it work.

No guarantees of course but thoroughly cleaning the IAC usually fixes this kind of problem. My goal is to get 1/3 of the can of TB cleaner through the IAC.

[How to clean your IAC (Idle Air Controller) valve | Jeep Wrangler TJ Forum](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/how-to-clean-your-iac-idle-air-controller-valve.662/)

actually removing the IAC to clean it is seldom required. When cleaned as suggested above, the IAC usually pulls in enough cleaner through itself to restore it back to good operating condition.

## arb air lockers
[ARB Lockers in TJ Rubicon | Pirate 4x4](https://www.pirate4x4.com/threads/arb-lockers-in-tj-rubicon.878353/)

RD116 or RD117?  
To install an ARB for TJ Rubicons '03-'06 WITH the thick gear set, you need an **RD117** front & rear.  
More specifically, you need an ARB with differential case # 013005 and flange cap assembly # 027305. That means that if you want to upgrade your rear to a 35 spline dana 44, then you need to find the ARB with this case and flange cap assembly (all other internal parts are the same). NOTE: on ARB's product guide it will say "Dana 44, 35 Spline, 3.73 & DN" for the ARB you need with the thick gear set. It doesn't say anything about Rubicon's, other than "call ARB" (which I found on another product sheet BTW). However, this is the correct locker even though it states "3.73 & down", because of the thick ring gear, and if you have a Rubicon, then you know that your gears are 4:10 & up.

To upgrade to a 33 spline D44 for the rear, you will need to contact ARB to have them assemble the correct one for you, since it's not a production locker they list as of yet. You still need the case & flange cap assembly as stated above.

So here's what the part numbers break down to for TJ Rubicon's with the Dana 44 thick gear set:
- 30 Spline (front & rear): RD117  
- 33 Spline (rear): call ARB  
- 35 Spline (rear): RD147  

Now, if you re-gear AND do an ARB at the same time, you can just get the normal 44 ring & pinion and normal ARB as listed on their product guide. However, I re-geared to 4:88 with the stock lockers, so I had to re-gear with the thick ring gear....which is how I ran into all this when I later installed the ARBs with the thick ring gear I already had in there.

If you are ditching your air locker and regearing at the same time just skip getting thick gears. Get the gears you want in a normal set and the appropriate locker for the 3.73 and up range.

## shocks

[Measuring for shock length and bumpstop length | Jeep Wrangler TJ Forum](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/measuring-for-shock-length-and-bumpstop-length.34285/post-558881)  
@freedom_in_4low:  
0. Measure the distance between shock mounts at ride height.
1. put your frame on jack stands
2. Remove wheels/tires
3. remove shocks and disconnect sway bar
4. let the axle droop all the way out and measure the distance between your shock mounts. You'll use this later to see how much shock extension you can use.
5. remove springs - if they won't come out, remove the axle end track bar bolt to let the axle droop farther. Remove the rubber jounce bumpers from the bump stop cups.
6. use a floor jack to cycle the axle all the way to full compression on each side and in the middle (to get both sides bumped at the same time. You're looking for any mechanical contact, such as a track bar hitting a diff cover, steering hitting anything, etc. For the tie rods you'll want to turn the wheel all the way in each direction. Measure how far your bump stops are from each other at the points where things touch that you don't want to touch, and measure the distance between your shock mounts at the same point.
7. Repeat number 6 with the tire on the side you are stuffing. Technically you can do it at the same time as #6, I just find things easier to see without a tire in the way so I separate them. Just see where the tire hits, again turning the wheel to both extremes. Note your bump stop and shock mount measurement, if it's greater than the one from step 6.
8. Go shopping for shocks. Find one that best uses your available travel as measured in steps 0, 4, 6, and 7, but puts your ride height roughly in the middle of the total travel. If the shock length you pick is longer than what you measured, you'l need to add bump stop to take up the difference, and that will cost you uptravel. If you can't get exactly in the middle, that's ok, just don't farther than you have to on one side or the other. I know 2.5" of downtravel isn't enough.

## add a trunk install
[Factory rear trunk | Jeep Wrangler TJ Forum](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/factory-rear-trunk.43457/post-729400)  

I used four M6 nutserts and four M6x20mm (maybe 15mm?) flanged bolts with a 1.00 pitch. The instatrunk originally came with thumb screws instead of bolts, but mine didn't have any with it and ACE did not have any in that size. I used the flanged bolts to eliminate the need for washers.  
The nutserts go into the hexagon holes behind the carpet on each side. There should be grommets there. Remove them and push the nutserts in their place. It's a tight squeeze so you'll have to use a little force. I think I used a rubber mallet.  
The nutserts are designed to expand on the inside and crimp against the sheet metal and the outer nutsert flange. You'll need to make a "tool" to set it. I would get an M6x30mm bolt and a couple of nuts in at least grade 8 to set the nutserts. If use use a cheap grade bolt, you'll most likely snap it with the force it's receiving.  
I used a socket on the bolt instead of a second wrench. This allows you to put equal force on the bolt and keep the nutsert straight in the hole. If the nutsert tilts to one side, it won't set properly. You don't have to go crazy with them though. You're not holding on a skid plate or rocker guards.  
Once your nutserts are set, you need to cut open a space for the bolts to pass through the carpet and into the nutserts. I believe the factory just cut little slits in the carpet. In hindsight I probably should have done this, but instead I used a soldering iron to "melt" through the carpet and seal the edges of the hole to prevent fraying.  
Before the iron was hot, I felt around until I found the nutsert under the carpet, and poked tiny holes for reference.  
Once my holes were poked, I heated up the iron and burned my bigger holes in. This melted the edge of the holes together to prevent potential fraying.  
Once I had my holes burned in, I lined up the trunk and installed my flanged M6x20mm (maybe 15mm?) bolts.

I drill a hole in the firewall right in front of the fuse block behind the dash. Run the wires inside and then I have industrial Velcro I use to stick them right to the metal frame on the bottom of the passenger air bag. Zip it off and adjust it, put it back and it is as protected as it needs to be.

I highly prefer putting the correction device that can be dialed in by spinning a small screwdriver, stored behind the glove box with the total length of wire running from the PCM connectors to right behind the glove box. Clean, efficient, simple. Run a fuse tap from the instrument cluster fuse, ground in the same area. Total power and ground wires are about 18" long.  
Yep, we drill a small hole in the firewall in front of the glove box, run a pair of wires from the correction device out through that, pick up the wires in the harness to the speedo at the PCM plugs, cut and splice and done.

Since the elegant part seems to be underappreciated, here is what it looks like when done the way we do it. At the firewall, small braided loom is the tap into the PCM harness. The folded back loom is the connector for the old hood light.
