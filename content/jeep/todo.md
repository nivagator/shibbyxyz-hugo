This is a bolt-in job, there's not much to it. Just know that there's usually no reason to have to replace the flywheel unless it is physically damaged. Also, don't have the surface of the flywheel resurfaced or refinished. The TJ's flywheel has a domed surface that would be removed if it was resurfaced. At the most, if it has any glazing on its surface, just remove it with a mild grade of sandpaper or emery cloth.

About the only thing not included in that kit that I'd recommend would be a different throwout bearing than what is included.

[How to bleed your brakes](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/how-to-bleed-your-brakes.528/)

Two quarts of DOT 3/4 is what you need. Start by using a turkey baster to suck the old dirty fluid out of the brake reservoir.

On a system that's never been bled before you may find yourself running 64oz+ through it to get clean fluid. You can do this initial bleed to get clean fluid one person, once it's clean you're going to need a second person to help. If you don't, air can get past the bleeder threads. Don't let the MC run dry.

Don't store open brake fluid, once you open a container it needs to be used.

If you need more than 5-7 bleeds per corner, stop and find the problem because flushing more fluid down the drain isn't going to fix the problem.

Open screw, pedal to the floor hard and fast, close screw, let pedal up, repeat.

## timing chain

## cooling system 

Drilling a hole into the thermostat's flange like shown below and positioning the hole at the top when installing it will help get rid of the trapped air more quickly. Some thermostats come with a vent hole already, just make sure to position it at the top when installing it.

"Calcium" AGM like the offerings from NAPA, O'Reillys, Duracell, etc., - good batteries at a more reasonable price point and suitable for most jeepers looking to upgrade from a flooded lead acid battery who either can't afford the price point of a Northstar or don't need the features of a pure lead AGM battery. I will probably buy one of these as my next battery

East Penn vs northstar  
differences between "thick plate calcium AGM batteries" such as the offerings by East Penn, and "thin plate pure lead AGM's" which include Northstar, Odyssey and Optima. The article concludes:

"Both the calcium AGM and the pure lead AGM crank longer and are more tolerant of deep cycle drains than OE maintenance-free batteries. That said, there is a performance difference among these two types of AGM battery. Since the thinner plates in the pure lead AGM have more surface area contact than the thicker plates in the calcium AGM, they are more efficient during both discharging and recharging. The calcium AGM is 'better' while the pure lead AGM is 'best.'"

See: http://www.hendonpub.com/law_and_order/articles/2015/04/agm_battery_technology

It appears from the article that in the hierarchy of AGM's the Napa Legend is better than a flooded lead acid battery but not in the same category as a pure lead AGM battery such as Northstar, Odyssey and Optima. It also explains the substantial price difference between the East Penn offerings and those of the other AGM manufacturers.

Be sure to get a Group 24 instead of a group 34 for the extra capacity.

34 is original
24 is taller, more capacity but lower amps

This is very, very true! Anyone installing a RMS should make sure to use the supplied plastic tab, to ensure the top seal doesn't get knicked. I've learned this one the hard way and had to make a trip to the part store for a second seal kit. Also, care has to be taken to ensure both the upper and lower halves are installed correctly, with the small lip facing forward.

Getting the pan off, with the front Dana 30 or 44 in place, requires unbolting the shocks, dropping the rear as far as it will go, and loosening the exhaust bolts, so the pan will clear.

tools are $200+, two sizes needed for the uppers and lowers.  
budget option is all thread rod and sockets  

[Johnny Joint Maintenance | Page 4 | WTJF](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/johnny-joint-maintenance.54875/post-958808)  
@rasband: All thread (or a long bolt), a cup that the housing can rest against, and a socket that is big enough to go around the bolt hole and rest on the washer on the snap ring side. 

[mr blaine: Johnny Joint Maintenance | WTJF](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/johnny-joint-maintenance.54875/post-957708)   
Two things are key. First, the socket you use to push in the washer to take the load off the snap ring needs to be larger than the hole in the washer by enough not to tilt into the hole. It also needs to be smaller than the amount of room that it takes to pop the snap ring out of the groove. **You can grind a flat on one side to give the snap ring eyes room to pop out.**  

The second thing is when you using all thread to squeeze the washer, **the opposite side needs to be on the body, not the other washer**. Otherwise, you can move the wrong washer or really have to squeeze the races towards each other in hopes that the one under the snap ring moves. React against the body opposite the snap ring and it all works much better.
