Still a list a mile long of things to do.

- Tires. I need them. I'll be ordering the Cooper Evolution M/Ts in 285/75r16 from Discount Tire in the next week.
- Cycle suspension, set bumps and measure shock travel. At first blush I think these shocks might be too short. As it sits, there's probably 70/30 up/down travel. I need to get actual measurements. @Farmergreg - I think you have this same spring/shock combo, though yours is an LJ. Did you have any concerns with shock travel on yours?
- Set control arm lengths for caster and wheel well centering. I really only adjusted the rear uppers to get the rear pinion as happy as possible with the stock driveshaft. I've had it out around town a few times and I might be getting a little low "growl" on acceleration. New tom woods shaft is ordered.
- Paint shock bodies assuming I keep them.  
- Rear adjustable track bar, probably the JKS OGS151.

My Savvy body lift shipped and should be here today! I can finally get around to painting and install the UCF extra clearance skid out the shed. Which reminds me, I need to order a MML and Savvy cable shifter.

Getting there...
