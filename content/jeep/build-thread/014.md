Took care of the broken shock bolts/welded nuts. The right angle dremel attachment made it easy with the mini cut off wheels. I was able to go up through the shock opening from below, cut through most of it and finish it off with a hammer and punch. A few more passes with the dremel to clean up the surface and its ready for paint.

I noticed I lost a center cap sometime in the last few weeks. I think they are ~$20 online unless someone has a few laying around. I have a new set of McGard lugs I'm going to put on once the rear is buttoned up.
