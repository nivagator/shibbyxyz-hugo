Got around to a couple of items on the punch list this weekend.

One of the rear speakers was buzzing. I assumed it was blown but after pulling the cover, it seemed fine. Turns out it was the dome light lens. A few well placed electrical tape strips and its quiet back there.

Got the spark plugs swapped. I had help from my oldest daughter. She's 12 and has really taken an interest in the Jeep and all the maintenance. Its been really fun to teach her about all the mechanical things going on under the hood.

The plugs were well worn. The rear most plug was coated in oil. Looks like the valve cover gasket has been added to the list.

Flushed the Prestone cleaner coolant. The color was nasty. Refilled with Thermocure and will run it this week and I'm expecting it to be even worse. I attempted to clear up my coolant reservoir per @DuvelSteve but didn't quite get it clear. I'll try it again after flushing the Thermocure.
