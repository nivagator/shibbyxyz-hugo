Busy weekend with lots of 10 year old softball, swim clinics and birthday parties. I did make time to take the boy out for a sonic drink run.

I installed the Toyota headlights with the included harness. Much better than the sealed beams. I need to aim them, but so far, its a worthwhile upgrade.

I'm planning to drop the gas skid tonight and assess the rear shock cross member. I'll clean it up and start the painting process tomorrow.
