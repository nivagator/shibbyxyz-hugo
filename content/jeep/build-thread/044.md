Had the Jeep out at BMRA yesterday and brought my son. He had a blast. Next time we'll camp and make a weekend out of it. The Jeep did great. The addition of the hand throttle this time out made all the difference.

Suspension travel looks good here. The driver is full drop limited by the shock. The tire is almost hanging, but just touching the ground. Spring is just about to unseat and the brake line has slack. Passenger side, there's still 1.5" of shock showing and no tire clearance concerns.
