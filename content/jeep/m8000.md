[reassembly](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/mystery-m8000-winch-driveshaft-wear-pattern.43150/post-722737): I would also suggest when you assemble the winch you do it vertically starting with the gearbox end and work up from there. This allows you to make sure that everything is stacking together properly as everything should just "fall" into place as you go. This also allows you to make sure the brake shaft is also the correct length as the motor will not be able to seat to the drum support if it is too long.

## Warn Short Winch Motor - 77893
This 12 volt 4.8 motor can be used to replace your M8 winch motor or can be swapped in to the old-style M8000 winches. The previous part number (25982) is obsolete. The old M8000 motor part number (25982) has been superseded by 77893, which is the correct short winch motor for the M8, the M8-s, and the M8000.
