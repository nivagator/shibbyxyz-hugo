[Todo Link: Axle U-Joints](/jeep/todo#axle-ujoints)

I'm hearing some chirp turning at low speeds and I'm going to start by replacing the axle u-joints. This involves removing the brakes, hubs, brake shields and as such, I'm considering replacing those as well. I might hold off on the pads and rotors as they still have plenty of life and I'm not having any noise or issues with the brakes.

- never use a press on axle ujoints  
- The hammer and socket method wont damage the yoke. 
- No need to protect the cap being driven in, it is much harder than any hammer so don't be afraid to beat on it.
- When you drive the first cap in, take it below flush so the other pin is sticking out a bit further. That way you can pull the cross halfway out of the installed cap and it sticks up high enough on the other side to get the second cap started and engage the needle bearings in both caps. That prevents a needle from falling over and getting trapped which is always a mess. That is also when you install the clip in the first cap's groove so when you hammer in the second cap, it pushes the first one back against the snap ring.
- When that is done, the second groove will be showing and when you install the snap ring, it will be loose. You need to set the caps back against the snap rings so the pressure of the cap pushes them against the inside of the yoke. That is done by holding the assembled axle pointing straight away from you in one hand and then taking a nice size hammer and smacking the yoke on the fat part right below the holes for the caps. Inertia will act upon the cross and move the cap outward to lock the snap ring in place. You can check all of this very simply. Once you get the joint installed, move it back and forth and you can feel the tightness from one side being shoved against the thrust bearing inside the cap. After you set both side back against the snap rings, it will free up the joint in a most noticeable manner.
- You should also try to rotate the snap ring in the groove with the end of a screwdriver by pushing on it. If it doesn't spin easily, that's good enough.
- Also why you see folks struggling to remove the snap rings. They don't understand that the previous installer did it correctly and they need to release the pressure by first smacking the cap inwards before trying to pry out the snap ring and then doing the same to the other side to get that snap ring out.

### troubleshooting

[WTJF: Can't remove front axle, any tips?](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/cant-remove-front-axle-any-tips.20707/)  

stuck hub:  
- Put a 2.5 inch wide tube, a big bolt, whatever behind the outer stub axle and the inner C and use the steering wheel to push the bearing out.
- beat on the 12 point bolts with 12 point socket too and drive it out
