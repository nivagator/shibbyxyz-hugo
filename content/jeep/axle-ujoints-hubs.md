I'm hearing some chirp turning at low speeds and I'm going to start by replacing the axle u-joints. This involves removing the brakes, hubs, brake shields and as such, I'm considering replacing those as well. I'm going to hold off on the pads and rotors as they still have plenty of life and I'm not having any noise or issues with the brakes.
