Amazon failed twice to get me the correct tie rod. the first attempt was literally an empty box. the internal moog box and the brown outer box were empty and clearly the tie rod had punched a hole through both of them. 

The second attempt, the part arrived but it was the wrong part. My issue was the same as @irun described. the part was stamped with WH1312 and appeared to be a right hand drive version with the bends mirrored from the expected part. 

I gave up after that and found one on ebay for a few bucks less, it arrived and was the correct part.
