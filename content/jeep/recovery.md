There are not but a small handful of sockets you need anyway for trail repairs.  
12 point 13mm 1/2" drive socket and a spare.  
Lug nut removal sockets and extensions.  
Specialty bits for the hub kit.  
Control arm sockets both sizes.  
2-3 Torx bits for stuff like the throttle body etc. that can't be done any other way and that includes the Tamper version for the ignition switch.  
13mm ratchet wrench to spin out the knuckle bolts a bit faster, not required but convenient.  
Diff cover sockets and drive shaft pinion yoke tools.  
Lug nut socket typically removes nuts on tie rod ends.  
Phillips #2 in a very quality version for taking the dash apart to get to wiring issues.  
  
When you go at it from that view point, the trail tool bag gets a whole bunch smaller. The stuff you use repeatedly in the garage is for convenience so you can get the "just right" tool. That doesn't apply to trail repairs.  

Prybar and not a wimpy little piece of shit.  
3 lb shop hammer with an unbreakable handle  
Very high quality Crescent wrench or similar.  
Breaker pipe, tube, etc. Or, long handle breaker style normal   ratchet in 1/2 and 3/8" square drive. Unwieldy for some stuff, needed for other stuff.
18" aluminum pipe wrench, Rigid or equivalent quality.
