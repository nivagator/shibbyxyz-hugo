### food
Kanab for lunch or dinner at Big Al's (right next to McDonald's)  
- bison burger; they're fantastic. Their onion rings and sweet potato fries are also legendary.

### Bryce Canyon
- Peekaboo Loop trail is a great, scenic hike...about 5.5 mi and the 'signature' trail for the park
- longer, slightly more challenging hike, Riggs Springs Loop Trail to Yovimpa Pass is just under 9 mi through red rock, into pines, thru the forest and back up thru a sandstone and pine mixture.
- Fairyland, It is a cut off just before the park entrance


- hidden gem about half way between Kanab and Paige. Wire Pass Trail to Buckskin Gulch. his one was about 4.4 miles out and back; pretty much all flat but amazing landscape/scenery and may be on your travel route

### Zion
- When we were leaving Zion we had to go through the tunnel. The tunnel is really cool it is on the edge of a cliff and is really long. There are no lights inside so it is a bit ominous.
- go through the tunnel as you get closer to the park you will see a visitors center. Once you get close to that start looking for places just off of the road to park. Or watch for the signs to the park parking lot, but if the guy in the booth tells you it is full just find some where close to the visitors center. They have a tram at the visitors center that will take you to the park.
- in between Kanab as DaveC pointed out is another National park called Coral Pink Sand dunes
