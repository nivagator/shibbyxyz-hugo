Ox is attenuator and cab studio. Has back end effects like their EMT plate reverb, 1176 compressor, and digital rack delay. All are stellar.

Playing their plugins are what made me preorder the QC when it dropped. They are seriously impressive.

[AMAZING TONES! NEURAL DSP TONE KING IMPERIAL MKII AMP PLUGIN](https://youtu.be/p1DjoJLX3QE?si=c6jaVErJMMo58y3s)  
The Neural DSP Tone King Imperial MK II plugin, killer organic earthy combo tones that accurately capture the 20w tube combo amp, in digital form! For info:

This would be your way to QC without buying a QC. I would think your PC would be beefy enough to run super low latency plugins.

Not to mention you can look at all the other archetypes they have and do their free trials to see if you want one thatâ€™s Friedman beefy. Each archetype has a few amps in it with weird names because of copyright and unique effects in each as well. Highly highly recommend them.

I loooooved the plini archetype. There was the most amazing clean compressed ambient tone preset in it that was so inspiring.
