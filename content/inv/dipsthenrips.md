## F - Ford
2021-08-11  
- F has a support level at 13.40, if it trades below that level the bottom could fall out. I'll be watching and perhaps reducing my long term position if it does

## INTC - Intel
2021-08-10  
- I think INTC is trading at a discount. its a long term play, but they have taken a few punches and i would expect them to improve significantly over the next year or two

2021-08-04
- added to my position at 53.95

## MU - Micron  
2021-08-12  
- shares drop below support level on downgrade from 105 to 75 by jpmc  
- MU looking bearish now. it doesn't look like support will hold at $73-75, possible the it returns to that level as a resistance point similar to late last year    
- did not consider the news as i should have  

2021-08-11  
- watching MU, weekly shows end to elliot triangle wave, potentially starting an impulse cycle, will wait for confirmation and perhaps add another share, even if not, might be testing a support level at 73.92

## ORI - old republic
2021-08-13
- announced 1.50 special div to be paid 10/6 to sharehoders of record on 9/15. at current price (~$26) thats about a 6% payout.
- entered at 26.14, 1.5/26.14 = 5.7%
- watch closely over the next month and scale accordingly in the interrim.
- entirely possible this is a pump
