After reading more build threads than I care to admit, I reckon its time I start one of my own.

First a little background story. My first car was a red '92 Jeep Wrangler. 4cy, 5 speed, zero lift, 31" A/Ts, and a wish list full of stuff I knew nothing about.

The Jeep really wasn't in great shape, but I didn't care. It had transmission problems and that's what killed it. When it was time for my younger brother to get a car, my dad traded it in for practically nothing and bought both of us cars. For the next five years I drove a Ford Ranger EDGE package. But I vowed that one day I would have a Jeep again. A real Jeep, one with round headlights! ;)

Last summer my wife and I found a TJ in our price range and we went for it.

2001 Silverstone Metallic, 4.0L, 5 sped, 68k miles, 4" Procomp lift, 33" Procomp all terrains! Honestly, it took a lot for me to see past all that friggin chrome.:fear:

It looked much better once I got it home and de-chromed the thing, got factory bumpers (for free!), and a new set of fender flares.

Little did I know, I had only began to catch the wonderful illness that is Jeep.
