I found some used wheels and tires from a member of my local Jeep club. A full set of 5 BFG KMs, 33x12.50x15 on stock Canyons, the wheel that originally came with the Jeep. The tires were in great shape and had tons of tread left, plus the guy gave me a great deal.

I saw this silver TJ in town with black headlight bezels and I was this close to spending $35 and order a set of my own when a buddy of mine said I should just paint them. Duh. Saved about $30 doing them my self.

Some friends called it and "emo" look. We no longer speak.
