Now the good stuff.

I wanted to get rid of the ticking time bomb that was my Dana 35. I was going to do an 8.8 and regear the whole thing until I found a guy selling his Rubi 44s on the local Jeep forum. Rubicon D44s, 4.88s, chromo shafts and factory lockers and pumps. He also threw in the Currie HD steering that was attached to the front D44. Needless to say, I was quite happy. I also installed JKS rear lower and front upper adjustable control arms.
