The KMs were getting a little worn and now that I had the stronger axles I decided to move up to 35s.

I loved my KMs so I opted for the KM2s. I decided to stick with my Canyons, I haven't had a problem with them. In hindsight, I think I would have gone with the new Kevlar MT/Rs and maybe find some Moabs or get some AEV wheels but overall I am happy with them. BFG makes a good tire, and they balanced relatively easy with standard wheel weights. Maybe when I move to 37s I can go crazy with the wheels. I have seen some good ideas lately...

To fit the 35s, I put on a JKS BL and MML plus a 3/4" spacer on the rear springs. I also got the cheap-o smittybilt tire carrier. Not my first choice but it gets the job done on a budget.
