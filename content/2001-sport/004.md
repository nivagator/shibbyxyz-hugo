Next were rock sliders from a local company here in the Dallas metroplex. Heavy duty and cheaper than any others I had found. I think I got them with the rails and powder coated for $200.

Something I was trying to ignore was the fact that I had a D35 in the rear. I bought and installed an Aussie Locker for my Dana 30 to take some of the stress off the back end when I was off road.

Then came the SYE/CV. I got an AA SYE and a Coast Custom driveshaft from David at Northridge4x4. Great guy and great service.
