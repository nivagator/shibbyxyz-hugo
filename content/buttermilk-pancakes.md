there's a lot of claims to the best pancake recipe. they are all incorrect. in my infinite wisdom, i possess the best buttermilk pancake recipe on the planet. 

people like to add a bunch of extras to their pancakes: vanilla, cinnamon, nutmg. none of that is necessary. simple is best. a nice maple syrup is all you need, but since simple is the name of the game here, it accepts chocolate chips or a fruit of your choice very well.

These are the best. better than just about every breakfast place I've been to with the exception of The Donut Hole in Destin, FL. 

### ingredients 

dry:  
- 3 cups flour  
- 3 tsp baking soda
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
  
wet:
- 4 cups buttermilk
- 4 eggs 
- 2/3 cup melted butter

if you're adding blueberries or strawberries, my recommendation is to slice the strawberries (blueberries are fine whole) and put them in the freezer. this keeps them from getting soggy and "staining" your pancakes as they cook. 

Admittedly, this makes a lot. It can be cut in half. i usually do and its a perfect amount for the family. 

1. melt the butter. 
2. preheat griddle to 350-375F or heat the waffle iron. 
3. Combine the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. this is not the bowl the batter will end up in. mix thoroughly with a whisk and set aside. 
4. in a smaller, separate bowl, whisk the eggs like you're making scrambled.
5. combine buttermilk and butter in a large bowl, mix until combined with a spatula. I prefer to use a bowl with a pour spout. 
6. add eggs to butter/milk bowl and mix well. 
7. right before you're ready to make the pancakes/waffles, pour the dry mixture into the wet bowl and mix until combined. lumps are ok here.
8. for pancakes, use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to portion each. for a waffle iron, i use about 3 scoops.
9. if you're adding fruit or chocolate chips, do so after you spoon out the pancake on the griddle but before you flip.
10. cook to your liking, flip once, etc etc.
11. the rest is rinse and repeat.
