# Installing i3 on an Arch base

This assumes a [bare install of arch linux](./install/#1-boot-to-iso), a [user created](./install/create-user) with [sudo privileges](./install/#sudo-privileges) and access to the AUR through [yay](./install/installing-yayaur-access)

## install base software
```bash
yay -S xorg lightdm lightdm-slick-greeter i3-wm i3status i3blocks dmenu rofi xfce4-terminal xfce4-thunar i3lock-color
```
- `xorg` is the 
- `lightdm` is the display manager
- `lightdm-slick-greeter` is the login screen 
- `i3-wm`, `i3status`, `i3blocks` and `i3lock-color` (aur) are the base i3 window manager
- `dmenu`, `rofi`, `xfce4-terminal` and `xfce4-thunar` are the base user interface software 

## display manger 
becuase we're fancy and using the slick greeter, we have to change the defaul in the lightdm config.
```bash
sudo vim /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
[Seat:*]
...
greeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter
...
```
once thats done, enable the display manager (`lightdm`) to start at system start
```bash
sudo systemctl enable lightdm.service
```
start lightdm. this will load the display manager and present you with the login screen
```bash
sudo systemctl start lightdm.service
```

## i3 first launch
login to your user account. i3 will prompt you with a series of popups to initialize the config. with that done, you are presented with a black, desolate desktop and i3bar at the bottom of the screen.

Congratulations, i3 is installed.
