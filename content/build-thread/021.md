Lift parts have arrived. I bit the bullet and ordered a complete set of Savvy arms. I'm undecided about painting them. I'm also unsure if they need to be coated with anything if they are not painted.

I'm planning to install the arms first, probably next week, then lift it after Thanksgiving. A driveshaft and potentially an adjustable rear TB will come after the install. Oh, and I still need brake lines.
