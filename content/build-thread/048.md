I completed the u-joint replacement with help from [this thread](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/u-joint-woes-help.64684/). I have no reason to believe they weren't the factory originals and took quite a bit of encouragement with a 3 lb mini-sledge. 

Old joint:

Lots of corrosion on the passenger, long side shaft. Not all that concerned about it. New shafts are on the list, but these will be fine for now and eventually as spares.
