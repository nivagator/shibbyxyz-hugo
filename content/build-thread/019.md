The stars aligned yesterday. I had the day off thanks to the brave American's who defend our great country (working for a bank has its perks), but the kids still had school and the wife still had work. I had the entire day to do Jeep things.

I picked up a set of KC Apollo Pro's off craigslist locally. I'll clean them up and wire them up over the weekend. I'm not sure if they are the 55w or 100w versions. Can I use the factory wiring with 100w fogs? I know I can get the 55w bulbs for them easily if needed.

Lowes has their 50-250ft/lb Craftsman torque wrench on sale for $50. I picked one up. I know craftsman maybe isn't what I used to be, but the sale price on this one is less than half of the HF Icon wrench i was looking to get. The 20-100ft/lb version is also on sale.  

I dropped the t-case skid and found more rust than i expected/hoped. There's some pitting on the frame rails but after cleaning it up with the grinder, they are still solid. The skid is in worse shape. I'll be adding a replacement to the list of parts to buy. Looking at the UCF extra clearance version. Nutserts looked ok, much better than expected. I have a replacement set from Mr Blaine that I'll probably swap in when i do the skid.

Once everything was clean, I started @Irun's paint prescription hitting the bare spots with rust reformer. Primer goes on tonight and top coat Saturday morning.

While the skid is off, I drained and filled the transmission. Drain plug magnet was pretty full of micro-shavings. I'll drain and fill the transfer case this evening.
