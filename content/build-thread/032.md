Received the LED backup lamps from @Claytone yesterday.

Drilled the separator plate and hooked them up in no time only to discover they weren't working. After some troubleshooting I was able to confirm my back-up lamp switch on the transmission was bad. I don't drive the Jeep much at night when I would have noticed the reverse lights, so who knows how long its been out. A quick swap with a replacement switch and they are working fine.

These lights are awesome. A really nice upgrade to the factory tail light housings.
