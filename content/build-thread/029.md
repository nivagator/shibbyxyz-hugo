Shock math:
​Shock | Compressed​ | Extended​ | Travel​ | Up (Potential)​ | Down​ | Bias (Up/Down)​ 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Rancho RS55239 (Front)​ | 14.43​ | 23.84​ | 9.41​ | 5.25​ | 4.16​ | 56/44​
Rancho RS55241 (Rear)​ | 13.69​ | 21.69​ | 8​ | 5.75​ | 2.25​ | 72/28​

'Up' is the exposed shock shaft length at ride height. This is the potential up travel and may be limited by fender clearance/bump stops. This was measured with half a tank of fuel, soft top, full doors and no passengers.

Fronts look fine, I don't have a significant rake so I don't plan to install leveling spacers. The rears might be on the short side we shall see.
