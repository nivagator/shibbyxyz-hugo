Got the lower control arm johnny joints greased over the last weekend. The uppers and track bar will have to wait.

Fixed a leak/squeak in the sub enclosure. The Kicker sub is a massive improvement. Kids are enjoying it.

Last minute decided to take my son on a solo run up to Bridgeport this afternoon. Tons of fun, he seems to really enjoy it.

Left the doors at home this time. Earplugs on the highway made all the difference. The park was mostly dry - a few sloppy mud ruts along the trails. Not very much traffic in the afternoon. It was very, very hot.

Jeep did great. Didn't do anything crazy since we were on our own. I got stuck once going up a rocky optional trail. I got off my line and behind an undercut boulder with my passenger rear tire. I was able to get back over and muscle it up. I think a couple of my wheels are going to be witnesses to that event. Smacked something pretty hard once but find what hit. I assume I'll find it while cleaning. The ride home was smoother than the ride out there. It was a great afternoon capped off with a stop at Buc-ee's for dinner.

Not many pictures - we only stopped to get out a few times to check lines. Here's most of them.

Doorless with the top on was a great combo of airflow and shade. In that heat, I'm not sure there was a better choice.

Got the caked on mud off the wheels. Could be worse. I thought this first one was going to be ugly. At the time, it looked like it shaved a sliver off the bead. Looks like it didn't get through the primer?

This one's nice and deep.

Not sure if this was done on the trip or not. This is the wheel that was caught in the undercut.
