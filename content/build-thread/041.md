Lots going on. I have just over a week before the next trip out assuming I can afford the gas next week. Hand throttle should arrive next Tuesday, really looking forward to having better throttle control on the trails.

Installed a rear recovery point:

Started wiring for independent locker controls. I have relays arriving this weekend to get the lights to function. Yes, I'm keeping the stock axle lock switch in place until I need the slot for something else.
