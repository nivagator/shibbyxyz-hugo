Nothing new to report, summer has been busy with kids sports. I've been driving the heck out of this Jeep and loving it.

I will say I'm hearing chirp from the u-joints at low speeds making turns leaving the neighborhood. Probably needs to jump up the list to replace sooner than later.

Other items on the list for the fall when it cools down:
- Front axle u-joints (sooner than later)
- RMS
- Oil pan and gasket
- Clutch replacement
- replace skid nutserts
- oil change
- tire rotation

Almost every weekend is booked through the rest of the summer. I need to get back out on the trails soon...
