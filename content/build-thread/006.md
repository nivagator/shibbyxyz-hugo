My doors, specifically the driver's side, were very hard to remove the first time i tried. The nuts were marked up like they had been removed, but the doors were stuck pretty good. It took a while, but I got them off without resorting to the jack method.

I ordered quadratec's replacement bushings and got around to installing them. The passenger side went off without a hitch. The kit is very complete and the instructions are excellent.

The lower hinge on the driver side door was another story. The kit comes with a punch tool that is machined to fit inside the bushing with a lip to drive it out. I started just as I had on the three others before. This time, instead of the bushing moving, the entire hinge started to rotate. This picture is after I rotated it back in place.

Not terribly worried about the paint. Should I tighten the torx bolts?

I didn't try again. The door went back on with no trouble. I guess three out of four isn't bad. :)
