Catch up post from the past few months. 

2022-10-07 - installed a new air filter: Wix 46081  
2022-11-12 - Installed new wipers: Bosch Microedge 40713

Somewhere along the way, I installed a set of [Skyjacker Black MAX rear shocks (B8528)](https://www.summitracing.com/parts/SJA-B8528) hoping to relieve stiff ride characteristics of the Rancho 5000x. They also run shaft down which allowed me to remove the shock extension brackets. These have been a huge improvement in ride quality. I haven't noticed any ill effects from running different shocks front (still Rancho) and rear. At some point, I might get a set of Black MAX for the front, but for now, I'm happy with the improved ride. 

I was given a factory trunk by a local forum member. My Jeep did not have the nutserts installed in the tub to mount the trunk. I followed a [detailed guide on WTJF](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/factory-rear-trunk.43457/post-729400) to set the nutserts and mount the trunk. Very nice addition. I'll probably look to add threaded knobs at some point in the future.
