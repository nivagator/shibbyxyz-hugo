Still waiting on tank straps... Amazon says they're in stock, expected to arrive 10/30 :unsure: I'm attempting to cancel and/or return them. Ordered a set from Summit. We'll see which one gets here first.

Lots of little updates:
Scored a factory front bumper from a buddy. The pro comp steel bumper that was on there wasn't deep enough for both top-side bolts. My guess is it was meant to pair with a winch plate? The factory bumper looks much better, its lighter and the tow hooks sit level now.

I pulled the factory locker pumps. They are a mess and the caps are a little rusty. I'll clean them up before relocating them. They both still work and hold pressure.

Installed Polk DB522 speakers up front.

Fixed the fog light switch in the multi-function unit on the column. Used my pretty pink junk towel this time. Just need fog lights now. I found set of KCs for $80 locally that I might pick up.

Still need to tackle the broken rear bumper bolts. I might get to it this evening.
