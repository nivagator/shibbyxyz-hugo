New O2 sensors installed without much fuss. The motor in general is running very smooth after the refresh.

WRG rope installed but not tensioned. Alas, I've disappointed everyone with my color choice. Nice to have the winch project finished.

[Hella H4 100/80w](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000COBLKW) bulbs were ordered for the Kioto lenses. I've been running the 60/55w bulbs included with the Toyota kit. As a refresher, I'm running the wiring harness that came with the kit as well.

Amazon decided to deliver one bulb yesterday and the other is coming, so I threw it in to see if there was a noticeable difference. Maybe you can tell.

The new bulb is on the right/drivers side. It is a bit brighter but I wouldn't notice it if I wasn't looking for it. It does have a cooler color temperature to it, just a bit less yellow, a bit more white.

My 15 year old smittybilt portable compressor hose cracked and they don't use standard fittings. I abandoned attempting to retrofit or buy a replacement and ordered a [Viair 88p](https://www.amazon.com/VIAIR-88-Portable-Air-Compressor/dp/B00HE7SDKQ). I've been using a battery powered Ryobi, but it takes forever and I don't love the idea of depending on a lithium battery to get aired up. I know the 88p won't set speed records, but its affordable and has a reputation for being reliable.

The 88p has a fixed hose and a screw-on style schrader connector. I'll order a [quick chuck](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TKMPX3K/) for it. Eventually, I might cut and add quick connect fittings to make the hose detachable. Possibly do something similar to the power wires with plug connectors. 

Cooling system is still running well. Temps are still consistently low-ish, 204-208. Not sure how much of a problem that is. I might consider trying a different thermostat in the future. I did find a puddle of coolant this morning after driving to the office. The lower hose is dripping at the radiator. I'll reseat the tension clamp and hose and see if that solves it. If the radiator has cracked somewhere, I've got the CSF replacement on hand. 

Assuming the leak can be resolved tonight, I'm meeting Matt out at BMRA tomorrow morning. The weather looks perfect.
