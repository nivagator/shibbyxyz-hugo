While we wait on the wizard...

My johnny joints are creaking again. I serviced the lowers almost exactly a year ago, but only about 3k miles. It's supposed to cool down a bit next week. I'll probably tackle it then.

I ordered a full set of NTK O2 sensors this week from RockAuto. I've been tracking and monitoring a bunch of metrics on the torque app. The O2 readings might suggest they are in need of replacement. That and I keep reading about NTK possibly dropping some part numbers? Not sure, but I grabbed a set. 

Still dealing with cooling issues on the highway, around 235+F this past weekend cruising at 70-75mph. Temps actually come down under idle or around town driving. Still higher than ideal at 215-225F. I did the flush and thermocure treatment a few years ago when I purchased it, but it's time to replace the cooling system. Radiator, hoses, water neck all look to be factory, the pump looks like it has been replaced.

While i'm in there... If I'm going to remove the radiator and water pump, I will have good access to the timing chain...

Its going to be a busy couple of weeks.

- Grease Johnny Joints
- Replace O2 sensors
- Replace cooling system
- Replace timing chain

I'm also having long crank starts which points to the check valve going out in the fuel pump. I haven't ordered parts for that, but I know its coming. Not looking forward to dropping the tank.
