Rolled around under the jeep yesterday after greasing the rear UCA JJs. A couple of things:
- power steering leak - fluid level is ok, steering isn't whining, but the ac compressor is pretty soaked. This could be as simple as one of the hose clamps on the reservoir.
- It looks like one of my Black Max shocks is leaking. Not completely unexpected based on the experience of others here. I'll contact skyjacker and see what they say.
