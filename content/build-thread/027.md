Lots of updates over the past few weeks. Christmas brought GraBars and a Spiderweb shade and the time off from work let me tackle the lift. Pretty much nothing went smoothly between the rusted bolts and trips to the hardware store for sockets and drill bits. I even managed to smack myself in the face with a crowbar fighting with the front track bar. The toughest parts were getting the rear track bar back in and the seized tie rod.
