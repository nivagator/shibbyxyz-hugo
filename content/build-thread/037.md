Finished up the rear this evening. Shortened the lower links to ~15.75" and squared the axle to the frame. Pinion is 15.4*, driveshaft is 16.2*. JKS track bar has clearance around the gas skid. I have not cycled everything again so more tweaks to come. I replaced the lower shock and track bar bolts with replacements from Bolt Depot. I got her up to 70mph on a late night joy ride with the top down. Zero issues, zero vibes. Noticeably smoother with the CV DS.

Until I get the body lift on, the spare wont clear the bumper on the stock mount. I know there are spacers, but I want to see how far off it is after the body lift before going the spacer route.

This week, I'll paint the UCF skid to be ready to tackle the body lift next weekend. Should have everything done in plenty of time. The extra 75+ lbs spare on the back and the tucked skid will affect the pinion/DS angle. Add that to the list to adjust. Until then, the forecast is 70 and sunny the next two days and I plan to enjoy it.
