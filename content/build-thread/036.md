Track bar and bracket, jounce bumpers, bumpstops and driveshaft are all in. Stupid JKS track bar is just grazing the gas skid, as expected. I'll take a 1/4" out of the lower CAs, reset everything and see where it is. Right now, lowers are at ~16", pinion angle is 15.5*, DS is at 16.2*. Also, my rear shocks are definitely too short. Confirmed, I've only got about 2" of down travel with the 55241s.
