I started the rear shock cross member clean up. There's rust, but its not bad. I broke 3 of 4 shock bolts. I'll finish cleaning it up and coat it in rustoleum rust reformer before prime and paint.

Speaking of broken bolts. I snapped a bumper bolt head off in glorious fashion and the internal frame mounted nut is spinning free. Good times.
