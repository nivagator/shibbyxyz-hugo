I did have a chance to test fit the winch plate this weekend. I've ordered new Curt tow hooks to fit between the angles on the plate and the fogs.

I also mounted the winch solenoid.

My daughter's softball season has ended as of this weekend. I should have time to finish the winch install in the next few weeks. Slowly but surely.

Winch plate marked for cuts to accommodate the WRG fairlead.
