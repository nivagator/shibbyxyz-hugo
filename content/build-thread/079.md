Jeff picked up a new steering wheel from the [dude in Poland](https://wranglertjforum.com/threads/nashville-tjs-build-continued.42035/post-1597909) and sent me his old wheel.

My wheel has a slight but noticeable cant on the top side toward the hood - it's been that way since I bought the Jeep. Visible here.

More visible when you put it back to back with Jeff's.

Borrowed a puller and it was quick swap. The leather feels nice and it's a definite upgrade over the molded, bent wheel. Thanks Jeff!
