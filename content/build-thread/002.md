Had a few hours this weekend and took care of a few things.  
- Oil Change (conv 5w30) 
- Prestone coolant flush
- Installed StreetRays seat risers

Did some trouble shooting on the rear locker; swapped the front/rear pump tubes. The rear pump locked the front diff just fine, so at least my pumps appear to be ok. I couldn't see anything in the rear air tube to the diff. I picked up gear oil and ordered lube locker. I'll pull the cover and check the internal tube when I have time.
