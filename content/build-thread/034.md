Tire install scheduled for Wednesday. I am excite.

![lifted](/build-thread/img/tire_size.png)

Shake down run at the end of the month. I made a list of everything on my radar at the moment.

Have parts waiting to install:  
- Savvy cable shifter
- Savvy body lift
- UCF Skid (needs paint)
- BMB replacement nutserts
- Bumpstop extensions
- Rear jounce bumpers
- Tom Woods CV driveshaft
- Angled trackbar bracket
- MORE steering riser

Waiting on parts:  
- Adjustable rear track bar
- Motor mount lift

Order of operations for the rear:  
1. Install rear trackbar and angle bracket
1. Position rear axle, check alignment at full bump
1. Install rear jounce bumpers and bumpstops
1. Install DS and set pinion angle, check axle position
1. Cycle the suspension for clearance and check bumps and rear shock length
1. Adjust, adjust, adjust until I'm happy

That will get me up and running. I may not get to the skid/BL/MML/shifter until next month. If the bumpstops I have aren't going to keep the tires out of the fenders, I'll get to it sooner than later. Everything is impacted by everything else....

Other items on my list in some other category are as follows

Investigate:  
- Subwoofer doesnt work
- Rattling noises behind drivers side dash?
- Steering "bump" felt through the steering wheel
- Front locker slow air leak

Future projects:  
- Oil pan/gasket and RMS (have parts on hand)
- Clutch (throw out bearing is making a ton of noise at times)
- Flip door handles
- Diff covers or armor?

Maintenance:  
- Mild surface rust in drivers footwell
- Loctite seat mounting bolts
