This summer has been brutally hot. It's 104F today and the Jeep did not like it. Coolant temps got as high as 239F on the highway on the OBDII readout and dropped to 231F on the road in town. Looks like I have more work to do.

I didn't replace and of the cooling system when I did the flush. Fan does not pinwheel hot or cold. I did notice the coolant reservoir was empty. Filled it and idled it up to temp. It hovered at 215F at idle and would drop to 210-210F with throttle. I'll keep an eye on it.
