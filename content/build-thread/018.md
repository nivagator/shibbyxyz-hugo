Finally back on the road. Gave up on Amazon and ordered tank straps from Summit. They arrived in two days and Amazon finally let me cancel my original order.

I took another look at the installed lugs. The kit looks like its made by Gorilla. You can see in [014](../014), the lugs are evenly slotted. I was never given a key, but I found a slotted key online that works perfectly. I started swapping the lugs, get the fronts done and move to the rear passenger wheel and the lugs are different... All 5 of the unique keyed lugs are on this one wheel.ðŸ¤¨ I've been told discount tire will get them off if you don't have the key for fairly cheap. I'll give them a call today.
