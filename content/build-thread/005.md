I did a more thorough inspection of the frame and underside. There's more rust than I want to see, but so far nothing devastating. Some light areas on the body and some surface rust on the frame around the control arm mounts. Its on my list to clean it up and paint this winter.

I am looking for a replacement set of factory control arms. The bushings are shot, but worse than that, the rear lowers look to be rusted pretty well inside the arm around the bushing itself. I'll get those replaced as soon as possible. I'm planning to run factory arms with 2" springs, might as well get it taken care of now.

There's a hole rusted through the gas skid. I'll replace it with an OEM part, hopefully I can find one locally. I am a bit concerned about how the rear cross member is going too look once the tank is out, tbh.
