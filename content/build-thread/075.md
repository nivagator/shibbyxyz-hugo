Had the jeep out at BMRA this past Saturday. Fairly decent turnout, not crowded though. [BMRA](https://barnwellmountainra.com/) is about a 3 hour drive from the house. With no soccer and no softball on a Saturday, I had my son and younger daughter with me for this trip. We got an early start and were at the gate at 8am. The park is a 1,850 acre "mountain" of red clay in east Texas, owned and maintained by TMTC. The main pavilion is at the top and trails run down and around. It is very dusty. After making the 200 yard drive from the gate to the pavilion, my daughter couldn't help herself:

Most of what I ran is ravines and washouts with some off camber stuff. There's harder stuff, sure, but this is what a lot of the property looks like. Ravines for days:

Ran with an easy group with Matt in the morning.

After lunch, Matt and his buddies let me and my little 33s tag along on a trail called Whatever. It's a ravine with a tricky section straddling a v. The ruts are deep and you can teeter a bit. Matt went first and tipped a bit nose up, I think. In the video, right at the start, I don't get far enough over passenger and nose down into the notch. Not deep enough to flop, but got the blood pumping a bit. A better line hugging the driver side wall coming out of it.

We split up and I spent the rest of the day running easy trails with my two kiddos. They really had a good time. It was nice having a photographer with me.

There was one decent climb. An XJ with open diffs was getting winched up when we got there. Fairly easy line for the Rubi. Daughter for scale.

The day ended with a run through the articulation chute. Used all available shock travel and bumps set correctly to prevent rubbing.

We stopped at Dairy Palace in Canton on the way home for a burger. It was a great day with my kids. Jeeps are pretty neat.
