I've started on the front end adjustments.

I noticed this when I installed my front track bar, but revisited it again. The axle side mount looks like its either wallowed or was drilled out. Not sure if this is a big deal or not.

Cycling the axle, the jounce cups and spring perches were off laterally by about 3/4" at full bump. The axle is square to the frame, but checking for center, it was only off about 1/16". Not sure where the miss is, I'll dig into it more this weekend.

Track bar made contact with the diff too. Not enough to catch, it slides, but I'll adjust. I saw later the frame side JJ wasn't level after this picture but, rotated with the rear side up. Not sure exactly if/how that would change things.

The good news is I only need 2" of bump stop with another half inch on the shock visible. I may get a few hockey pucks to cut in half to take advantage of that last half inch. I screwed up the passenger side pad and drilled the hole too big for the 1/2" tap. Guess I'll move up to 9/16".

Lowers measure just over 15.75".

Still on the list:  
- Finish front bump stops
- Install hand throttle
- Check axle center
- Align and recenter steering wheel
- Adjust steering stops
- Persuade the gas skid to provide a bit more clearance on the rear track bar.
