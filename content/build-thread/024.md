Opened the rear diff last night. My oldest volunteered to help. Its nice to have extra hands to hand you tools. I quickly learned your helper needs to know the names of tools to be... helpful. I did get really good a describing where and what to look for. :LOL:

I started working on the locker air fitting replacement. Getting the old one out is going to be more challenging than expected. Gears, oil and everything else look to be in great shape.
