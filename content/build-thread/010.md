So far no leaks and the 4.0 is running smooth. The lifter tick is all but gone, if that's even what it was in the first place. All the rocker arms and rods were tight when i had the cover off.

I took a grinder to the abs tray this afternoon. It had some decent rust spots. I'll get it painted and prepped for the locker pump relocation.
