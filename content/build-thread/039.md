Swapped the shocks. More shock math. All of this is theoretical until I cycle, set bumps. In other words, largely meaningless.

Shock | Compressed | Extended|Travel|Up (Potential)|Down|Bias
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Rancho RS55239 (Front)​|14.43​|23.84​|9.41​|5.25​|4.16​|56/44​
Rancho RS55241 (Rear) Pre-Tuck​|13.69​|21.69​|8​|5.75​|2.25​|72/28​
Rancho RS55241 (Rear) Post-Tuck​|13.69​|21.69​|8​|6.15​|1.85​|77/23​
Rancho RS55256 (Rear)​|15.06​|24.68​|9.62​|4.75​|4.87​|49/51​

Up potential is the exposed shock shaft length at ride height. I doubt i get the 4.75 up with other clearance issues. I'm going to hang on to the 241s for now.
