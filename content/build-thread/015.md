Placing orders this week for the lift. Here's the prospective parts list with the goal of running 285/75r16s (~32.8"). I will add a body lift if (when) needed to clear the tires.

JKS JSPEC 3" Springs JSPEC3300
Rancho RS5000x 2.5" 55239/55241
RockJock Front Track Bar CE-9120TJS
JKS Rear Track Bar Bracket OGS160
Savvy Control Arms CE-9100SE

To be decided:  
Bumpstops:  
Rock Krawler bump stop kit RK05611

Brake Lines:  
YJ option, unless there's a reason to go another way.  

Sway Links:  
Eventually, I want to go with a SwayLoc and I don't really want to spend for the JKS discos. I'm looking at Zone's extended sway links front and rear. I can make DIY discos for the time being.  
Front: Zone Sway Links 3-4 Lift - J5303
Rear: Zone Sway Links 2-3 Lift - J5200

I'll order a driveshaft from Tom Woods and evaluate the need for an adjustable rear track bar once its all installed.
