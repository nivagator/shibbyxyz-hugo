Placing orders this week for the lift. Here's the prospective parts list with the goal of running 285/75r16s (~32.8"). I will add a body lift if (when) needed to clear the tires.

JKS JSPEC 3" Springs [JSPEC3300 - Northridge4x4](https://www.northridge4x4.com/shop/product/jspec3300-jks-3in-jspec-coil-spring-kit)  
Rancho RS5000x 2.5" [55239](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QWX6C6K/?tag=wranglerorg-20)/[55241](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QWX6JOU/?tag=wranglerorg-20) - Amazon (any reason to get the kit vs individuals?)  
RockJock Front Track Bar [CE-9120TJS - Rokmen](https://www.rokmen.com/jeep/suspension/accessories/track-bars/johnny-jointr-adjustable-front-trac-bar-for-tj-xj-lj-mj.html) (its $365 here vs $423 most other retailers, why?)  
JKS Rear Track Bar Bracket [OGS160 - Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005TTZSQS/?tag=wranglerorg-20)  
Savvy Control Arms [CE-9100SE - Savvy](https://savvyoffroad.com/product/ce-9100sa/) 

To be decided:  
Bumpstops:  
Rock Krawler bump stop kit - [RK05611](https://www.northridge4x4.com/shop/product/rk05611-rock-krawler-front-bump-stop-kit) or skip the kit and just get hockey pucks?

Brake Lines:  
YJ option, unless there's a reason to go another way.  
Front Left: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IY2CHHK/?tag=wranglerorg-20  
Front Right: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IY2CBTY/?tag=wranglerorg-20  
Rear Center: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IY2C63K/?tag=wranglerorg-20  

Sway Links:  
Eventually, I want to go with a SwayLoc and I don't really want to spend for the JKS discos. I'm looking at Zone's extended sway links front and rear. I can make DIY discos for the time being.  
Front: Zone Sway Links 3-4 Lift - [J5303](https://www.northridge4x4.com/shop/product/j5303-zone-offroad-front-sway-bar-links-lift-3-4in-lift)  
Rear: Zone Sway Links 2-3 Lift - [J5200](https://www.northridge4x4.com/shop/product/j5200-zone-offroad-rear-sway-bar-links-lift-2in)  

I'll order a driveshaft from Tom Woods and evaluate the need for an adjustable rear track bar once its all installed.
