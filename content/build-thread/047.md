I've started my shopping list for the axle u-joints. 

While I'm in there, my plan is to replace the rusted out brake shields. Pads and rotors look fine and have plenty of life left. I'll save that for another day.

What other items should I be considering? I thought about bearings/hubs and ball joints since I'm sure they are originals and the Jeep is at 135k miles. I'll check the ball joints and hubs for play before ordering.

Would there be any reason to proactively order [replacement hub bolts](https://www.amazon.com/Dorman-917-509-Bearing-Mounting-Bolts/dp/B01ID3YKXI)? 

part | qty | $
---|---|---
[5-760x ujoint](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009X1XDZG/) | 2 | $23/ea
[brake shield L](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074MMV85G/) | 1 | $20
[brake shield R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074MM8HTR/) | 1 | $20
[Spindle nut kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CO8ZQU/) | 2 | $9/ea
[Timken HA597449 Hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BZAF36/) | 2 | $70/ea
[Spicer 706944X ball joint kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N6OHI0/) | 2 | $66/ea

The spindle nut kits might be unnecessary, but they are cheap enough to be a "might as well..." item. 


As far as tools are concerned: 
- 36mm deep impact socket for the spindle nut 
- 13mm 12pt socket for the hub bolts
- Impact wrench
- 50-250ft/lb torque wrench
- ball joint press

I'll probably order everything and plan to tackle it sometime next month.
