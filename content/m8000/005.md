Haven't had much time over the past week. The winch is still in pieces on the work bench. I did get the contactor housing painted, the contactor itself cleaned up and the bad pin swapped out thanks to Blackjack! 

The drum needs to be wire brushed and painted(?). Other than that, I have everything I need to finish servicing and reassembling the winch. I hope to get to that this week.
