Found a used Warn M8000 locally. 

![m8000](../img/001_m8000.jpg)

Its in decent shape but needs a few things. Here's what I know so far:
- Missing ground screw (M8 x 1.25 x 12mm)
- Missing ground lead (2 guage, 72in) - [Spartan Power](https://spartanpower.com/product/custom-battery-cables/)
- Winch line is kinked and I want to run synthetic
  - 3/8", 85ft probably TRE unless Blaine has some ready to go
  - Safety Thimble - [WRG](https://www.shop.blackmagicbrakes.com/Wizard-Recovery-Gear-Safety-Thimble-Black-WRG-STD-SAFETY-THIMBLE.htm)
  - ST fairlead - [WRG](https://www.shop.blackmagicbrakes.com/Wizard-Recovery-Gear-ST-FAIRLEAD-WRG-ST-FAIRLEAD.htm) 
- Winch free spools fine, but the lever is very difficult to turn. I'll crack the gearbox and see where its getting hung up. 
- Mounting hardware
  - Square nuts (3/8-16)
  - Washers (3/8)
  - Bolts (3/8-16 x 1 1/4‚Äù)
- One of the contactor plug pins is bent. The plug wont insert all the way in. Winch works, but I'm going to see if I can fix the pin. 
- General clean up, [grease](https://www.montanajacks.com/products/phillips-66-moly-low-temp-grease) and paint 
- Decal for the side of the contactor pack because vanity

Is there a specific grade I need to get for the mounting square nuts? Stainless? Zinc?

For the clutch lever stiffness, what should I be looking for when I open the gear box? 

Any tips for straightening/correcting the bent contactor pin?
