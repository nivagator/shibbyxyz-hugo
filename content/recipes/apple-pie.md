## crust

1. combine flour and salt in medium bowl. cut in shortening pulling two knives or with a pastry blender until particles are the size of small peas. sprinkle with cold water one tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost leaves the side of the bowl. not all water must be used.
2. divide in halves and gather each into a ball. shape each into a flattened round on a lightly floured surface. wrap in plastic wrap and place in refrigerator at least 45 minutes allowing the shortening to become firm again. this is key to getting a flaky crust. allow to soften slightly before handling if refrigerated for longer.
3. roll pastry on lightly floured surface using the old yellow cup or a floured rolling pin. final circle Ma
